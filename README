For the sake of the security please generate new certificates and private keys when using TLS.

To generate new certificate - key pairs you can use GitBash with the following command:

`openssl req -nodes -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365`

then update the certificate and key path in code
